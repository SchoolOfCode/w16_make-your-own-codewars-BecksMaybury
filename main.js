Weather Forecaster
Given a temperature, your weather forecaster should tell you whether it is cold, cool, warm, hot or scorchio.
The temperature will be a number (can be negative, not always a whole number).
Temperatures below 5 are cold, between 5 and 12 are cool, between 13 and 18 are warm, between 19 and 25 are hot and anything over 25 are scorchio.

? add a temperature scale eg Celcius of Farenheit
