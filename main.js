WEATHER FORECASTER

Given a temperature, your weather forecaster should tell you whether it is cold, cool, warm, hot or scorchio outside.

The temperature will be a number (can be negative, not always a whole number).

Forecasts for temperatures:

- below 5 is cold
- between 5 and 12 is cool
- between 13 and 18 is warm
- between 19 and 25 is hot
- over 25 is scorchio

The forecast should be returned as a string "The temperature outside is (forecast)"

? add a temperature scale eg Celcius of Farenheit
